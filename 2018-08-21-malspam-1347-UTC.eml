<body>
	I have a complaint to be made on the days between 4/14/2018 to 4/16/2018 stay at The Eagle Inn was all paid in cash, but I left my final card 4785 Visa for additional expenses in which it was not necessary , today I received the invoice and there is a debit in the amount of 420 dollars on behalf of The Eagle Inn I would like immediate refund, because my invoice and direct debit and has already been paid.
I await the return of your part in attachment sending the proof of debit with the statement of undue debit.
